                    <p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel,
                         with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
                         [12] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer.
                         As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems,
                         every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
                         independent of network access or a central server.
                         [13] Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2.

                    <p>Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper,
                         a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.
                         [14][15] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell 
                         had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.
                         [16] The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.
